I am an energetic, ambitious person who has developed a mature and responsible approach to any
task that I undertake, or situation that I am presented with. As a MERN-stack web developer, I try to
accomplish all the tasks in a fixed amount of time depending on the taskâ€™s difficulty level. Although I
have no job experience, I try to perform my duties efficiently. I have done many individual assignments
and group tasks during my training and completed them successfully. I have the experience to
manage my time besides studying and working on projects in a short time because I am a student
now.
